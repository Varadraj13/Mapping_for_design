## 5. TRADE ROUTE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE

### Pre-Colonial Trade System (1500-1880s)

#### Luba Trading Organization
1. **Salt Trade** (Primary commodity)
   - Source: Local salt extraction from evaporation pans
   - Destination: Protein-starved savanna regions
   - Exchange: Millet, game, other agricultural products
   - Volume: Estimated high volume, regular tribute system

2. **Copper Trade**
   - Source: Central Katanga/Zambia Copperbelt deposits
   - Role: Prestige items, wealth indicators
   - Distribution: Through Luba court monopoly
   - Route: Via Kasai system westward

3. **Iron Working**
   - Production: Local smithcraft highly valued
   - Products: Tools, weapons, trade goods
   - Exchange networks: Regional demand throughout Central Africa

4. **Fish & Fish Products**
   - Source: Upemba lakes and rivers
   - Dried fish: Major dietary staple for trade
   - Volume: Supplied savanna regions with protein
   - Organization: Specialized fishing communities

#### Lunda Trading Organization
1. **Tributary System**
   - Vassal kingdoms paid tribute in valuable goods
   - Paramount ruler (Mwata Yamvo) redistributed prestige items
   - Created political loyalty through economic patronage

2. **International Trade**
   - Connection through Nyangwe to Arab-Swahili networks
   - Ivory trade with Zanzibar sultanate
   - Slave trade (17th-19th centuries)
   - Gold trade (limited, southern connections)

3. **Internal Redistribution**
   - Centralized collection from chieftainships
   - Royal monopoly on luxury goods (copper, salt, cloth)
   - Ritual redistribution reinforced political authority

### 19th Century Trade Network Collapse (1870s-1890s)

**Congo Arab War Period** (1892-1894):
- Kasongo captured by Congo Free State (April 22, 1893)
- Nyangwe destroyed (March-April 1893)
- Traditional trade networks disrupted
- Redirect: Exports rerouted from East Africa through Stanley Pool to Atlantic ports
- Impact: Economic collapse of traditional states

## 10. CONCLUSION

The Luba Kingdom and Lunda Empire represent two distinct but interconnected state systems in pre-colonial Central Africa. The Luba, based in the productive Upemba Depression, developed a sophisticated tribute system centered on salt and fish redistribution. The Lunda confederation extended further west and south, connecting multiple ecological zones through a vassal state structure. Both states' territories were fundamentally shaped by major riverine systems—the Kasai, Lualaba, and their tributaries—which served simultaneously as boundaries, transportation networks, and economic corridors linking Atlantic and Indian Ocean trade systems.

The collapse of both states in the late 19th century resulted from external pressures: the eastern trade in slaves and ivory disrupted traditional hierarchies, and firearms-equipped Chokwe invasions overwhelmed both kingdoms by the 1890s. The Congo Arab War of 1892-1894 definitively ended independent Lunda and Luba authority when the Congo Free State conquered their territories and redirected trade routes from eastern overland routes through Stanley Pool to the Atlantic.
